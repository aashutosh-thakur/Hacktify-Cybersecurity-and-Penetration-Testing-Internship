# Hacktify-Cybersecurity-and-Penetration-Testing-Internship
This repository contains materials from my internship at Hacktify Cyber Security (February 2025 - March 2025), showcasing my experience in vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and CTF challenges.
# 🛡️ Internship Overview
During this 1-month remote internship, I focused on identifying and mitigating common web application vulnerabilities through hands-on exercises and real-world scenarios.
# 📚 Skills Developed
Web Application Security Testing
Vulnerability Assessment
Penetration Testing
CTF Problem Solving
Security Report Writing
# 🔍 Vulnerabilities Explored
The repository is organized by weekly modules:
# Week 1: Client-Side Attacks
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
HTML Injection
Attack vectors and mitigation strategies
# Week 2: Server-Side Vulnerabilities
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
SQL Injection attacks and prevention
# Week 3: Web Security Mechanisms
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) vulnerabilities
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
# Week 4: Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges
I successfully completed multiple CTF challenges, earning a total of 450 points:
OSINT Challenge (100 points): Decoded a ROT47 cipher to retrieve a hidden flag from an encrypted file.
Web 2.0 Challenge (100 points): Discovered hidden content on a website using reconnaissance techniques beyond simple brute-force enumeration.
Cryptography Challenge (100 points): Decoded a message encrypted with the ReverseFuck esoteric programming language.
Reverse Engineering Challenge (150 points): Analyzed a project file to extract hidden text using advanced reverse engineering techniques.
